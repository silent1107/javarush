# Contributing in Our Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing! We're excited to see your ideas.
To ensure a smooth process, please follow these simple guidelines.

## How to contribute

1. **Discuss First:** Before you start writing code, please open an "Issue" on
GitHub to discuss the bug you want to fix or the feature you want to add. This
helps us avoid duplicated work and make sure your idea aligns with the project's
goals.

2. **Create a Branch:** Once your idea is approved, create a new branch from 
`main`. Please use a descriptive name, for example:
* `feature/add-user-authentification`
* `fix/correct-login-validation`

3. **Make Your Changes:** Write your code, add your documentation, and make 
your changes within your new branch.
